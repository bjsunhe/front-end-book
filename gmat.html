Advertising by mail has become much less effective, with fewer consumers responding. Because
consumers are increasingly overwhelmed by the sheer amount of junk mail they receive, most
discard almost all offers without considering them. Thus, an effective way for corporations to
improve response rates would be to more carefully target the individuals to whom they mail
advertising, thereby cutting down on the amount of junk mail each consumer receives.
Which of the following, if true, would most support the recommendation above?

(A) There are cost-effective means by which corporations that currently advertise by mail could
improve response rates.
(B) Many successful corporations are already carefully targeting the individuals to whom they mail
advertising.
(C) Any consumer who, immediately after receiving an advertisement by mail, merely glances at it,
is very likely to discard it.
(D) Improvements in the quality of the advertising materials used in mail that is carefully targeted
to individuals can improve the response rate for such mail.
(E) Response rates to carefully targeted advertisements by mail are considerably higher, on
average, than response rates to most other forms of advertising.







Politician: Hybrid cars use significantly less fuel per kilometer than nonhybrids. And fuel produces
air pollution, which contributes to a number of environmental problems. Motorists can save money
by driving cars that are more fuel efficient, and they will be encouraged to drive hybrid cars if we
make them aware of that fact. Therefore, we can help reduce the total amount of pollution emitted
by cars in this country by highlighting this advantage of hybrid cars.

Which of the following, if true, would most indicate a vulnerability of the politicianâ€™s argument?
(A) People with more fuel-efficient cars typically drive more than do those with less fuel-efficient
cars.
(B) Not all air pollution originates from automobiles.
(C) Hybrid cars have already begun to gain popularity.
(D) Fuel-efficient alternatives to hybrid cars will likely become available in the future.
(E) The future cost of gasoline and other fuel cannot be predicted with absolute precision or
certainty.
