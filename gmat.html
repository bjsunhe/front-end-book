Advertising by mail has become much less effective, with fewer consumers responding. Because
consumers are increasingly overwhelmed by the sheer amount of junk mail they receive, most
discard almost all offers without considering them. Thus, an effective way for corporations to
improve response rates would be to more carefully target the individuals to whom they mail
advertising, thereby cutting down on the amount of junk mail each consumer receives.
Which of the following, if true, would most support the recommendation above?

(A) There are cost-effective means by which corporations that currently advertise by mail could
improve response rates.
(B) Many successful corporations are already carefully targeting the individuals to whom they mail
advertising.
(C) Any consumer who, immediately after receiving an advertisement by mail, merely glances at it,
is very likely to discard it.
(D) Improvements in the quality of the advertising materials used in mail that is carefully targeted
to individuals can improve the response rate for such mail.
(E) Response rates to carefully targeted advertisements by mail are considerably higher, on
average, than response rates to most other forms of advertising.
